##Exercise8.1

> Write a function that takes and returns an *istream&*. The function should read the stream until it hits end-of-file.
> The function should print what it reads to the standard output. Reset the stream so that it is valid before returning
> the stream.

##Exercise8.2

> Test your function by calling it, passing *cin* as an argument.

##Exercise8.3

> what causes the following *while* to terminate?

##Exercise8.20

> When are friends useful? Dismiss the pros and cons of using friends.

##Exercise8.22

> Update your *Sales_data* class to hide its implementation. The programs you've written to use *Sales_data* operations
> should still continue to work. Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work.

##Exercise8.23

> Update your *Person* class to hide its implementation.
