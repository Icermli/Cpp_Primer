##Exercise4.1

> What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2?

105

##Exercise4.2

> Using Table 4.12(p. 166) parenthesize the following expressions to indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:

```cpp
(a) * vec.begin() // *(vec.begin())
(b) * vec.begin() + 1 // (*(vec.begin())) + 1
```

##Exercise4.3

> Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opprtunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the languege by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptble trade-off? Why or why not?
