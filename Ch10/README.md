## Exercise 10.01

> The `algorithm` header defined a function named `count` that, like `find`, takes a pair of iterators and a value. `count` returns a count of how often that value appears. Read a sequence of `int`s into a `vector` and point the `count` of how many elements have a given value.

## Exercise 10.02

> Repeat the previous program, but read values into a `list` of `string`s.

## Exercise 10.03

> Use `accumulate` to sum the elements in a `vector<int>`.

## Exercise 10.04

> Assuming `v` is a `vector<double>`, what, if anything, is wrong with calling `accumulate(v.cbegin(),v.cend(),0)`.

## Exercise 10.05

> In the call to `equal` on rosters, what would happen if both rosters held C-style strings, rather than library `string`s?

## Exercise 10.06

> Using `fill_n`, write a program to set a sequence of `int` values to 0.
