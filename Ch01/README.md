##Exercise 1.1 

> Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

[ex1.1-codelink](exercise1.1.cc)

##Exercise 1.2 

> Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

##Exercise 1.3

> Write a program used to print Hello, World on the standard output.

[ex1.3-codelink](exercise1.3.cc)

##Exercise 1.4

> Our program used the addition, +, to add two numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print each operand.

[ex1.4-codelink](exercise1.4.cc)

##Exercise 1.5

> We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use a separate statement to print each operand.

##Exercise 1.6

> Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.

```cpp
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
> If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

[ex1.6-codelink](exercise1.6.cc)

##Exercise 1.7

> Compile a program that has incorrectly nested comments.

##Exercise 1.8

> Indicate which, if any, of the following output statements are legal:

```cpp
std::cout << "/*";
std::cout << "*/";
std::cout << /* "*/" */;
std::cout << /*  "*/" /*  "/*"  */;
```
> After you've predicted what will happen, test your answers by compiling a aprogram with each of these statements. Correct any errors you encounter.

[ex1.8-codelink](exercise1.8.cc)

##Exercise 1.9

> Write a program that uses a while to sum the numbers from 50 to 100.

[ex1.9-codelink](exercise1.9.cc)

##Exercise 1.10

> In addition to the ++ operator that adds 1 to its operand, there is a decrement operator (--) that substracts 1. Use the decrement operator to write a while that prints the numbers from ten down to zero.

[ex1.10-codelink](exercise1.10.cc)

##Exercise 1.11

> Write a program that prompts the user for two integers. Print each number in the range specified by those two integers.
