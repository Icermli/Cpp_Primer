## Exercise 7.1

[ex7.1-codelink](exercise7.01.cpp)

## Exercise 7.2

> Add the *combine* and *isbn* members to the *Sales_data* class you wrote for the exercises in

[ex7.2-codelink](exercise7.02.hpp)

## Exercise 7.3

> Revise your transaction-processing program from ยง 7.1.1 (p.256) to use these members.

[ex7.3-codelink](exercise7.03.cpp)

## Exercise 7.4

> Write a class named `Person` that represents the name and address of a person. Use a `string` to hold each of these
> elements. Subsequent exercises will incrementally add features to this class.

[ex7.4-codelink](exercise7.04.hpp)

## Exercise 7.5

> Provide operations in your `Person` class to return the name and address. Should these functions be `const`? Explain
> your choice.

[ex7.5-codelink](exercise7.05.hpp)

## Exercise 7.6

> Define your own versions of the `add`, `read`, and `print` functions.

[ex7.6-codelink](exercise7.06.hpp)

## Exercise 7.7

> Rewrite the transaction-processing program you wrote for the exercises in ยง 7.1.2 (p.260) to use these new functions.

[ex7.7-codelink](exercise7.07.cpp)

## Exercise 7.8

> Why does `read` defines its `Sales_data` parameter as a plain reference and `print` define its parameter as a
> reference to const?

function `read` is intended to change the parameter member `revenue`'s value, so it is a plain reference.

function `print` just print out the parameter and it's not intend to change anything.

## Exercise 7.9

> Add operations to read and print `Person` objects to the code you wrote for the exercises in ยง 7.1.2 (p.260).

## Exercise 7.10

> What does the condition in the following `if` statement do?

```cpp
if (read(read(cin, data1), data2))
```

`if` statement read two `Sales_data` object at once.

## Exercise 7.11

> Add constructors to your *Sales_data* class and write a program to use each of the constructors.

[ex7.11.h-codelink](exercise7.11.h)

[ex7.11.cpp-codelink](exercise7.11.cpp)

## Exercise 7.12

> Move the definition of the `Sales_data` constructor that takes an `istream` into the body of the `Sales_data` class.

[ex7.12-codelink](exercise7.12.hpp)

## Exercise 7.13

> Rewrite the program from page 255 to use the `istream` constructor.

[ex7.13-codelink](exercise7.13.cpp)

## Exercise 7.14

> Write a version of the default constructor that explicitly initializes the members to the values we have provided as in-class initializers.

```cpp
Sales_data(): units_sold(0), revenue(0.0) { };
```

## Exercise 7.15

Add appropriate constructors to your `Person` class.

[ex7.15-codelink](exercise7.15.hpp)

## Exercise 7.16

> What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an access specifier may appear inside a class definition?
> What kinds of members should be defined after a `public` specifier? What kinds should be `private`?  

There are no restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear. The specifier access level remains in effect
until the next access specifier or the end of the class body.

The members which are accessible to all parts of the program should define after a public specifier.

The members which are accessible to the member functions of the class but are not accessible to code that uses the
class should define after a private specifier.

## Exercise 7.17

> What, if any, are the differences between using `class` or `struct`?

The only difference between using `class` and using `struct`
 to define a class is the default access level. (`class`: private, `struct`: public)

## Exercise 7.18

> What is encapsulation? Why is it useful?

encapsulation is the separation of implementation from interface. It hides the implementation details of a type. (In
C++, encapsulation is enforced by putting the implementation in the private part of a class)

Important advantages:

- User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulation object.
- The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without requiring changes in user-level code.

## Exercise 7.19

> Indicate which members of your `Person` class you would declare as `public` and which you would declare as `private`.
> Explain your choice.

public: constructors, `getName()`, `getAddress()`. private: `name`, `address`.

the interface should be defined as public, the data should not expose to outside of the class.

## Exercise 7.20

> When are friends useful? Dismiss the pros and cons of using friends.

## Exercise 7.22

> Update your *Sales_data* class to hide its implementation. The programs you've written to use *Sales_data* operations
> should still continue to work. Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work.

##Exercise 7.23

> Update your *Person* class to hide its implementation.
