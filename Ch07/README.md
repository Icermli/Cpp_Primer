## Exercise 7.2

> Add the *combine* and *isbn* members to the *Sales_data* class you wrote for the exercises in

[ex7.2-codelink](exercise7.02.cpp)

## Exercise 7.3

> Revise your transaction-processing program from ยง 7.1.1 (p.256) to use these members.

[ex7.3-codelink](exercise7.03.cpp)

## Exercise 7.4

> Write a class named `Person` that represents the name and address of a person. Use a `string` to hold each of these
> elements. Subsequent exercises will incrementally add features to this class.

## Exercise 7.5

> Provide operations in your `Person` class to return the name and address. Should these functions be `const`? Explain
> your choice.

## Exercise 7.20

> When are friends useful? Dismiss the pros and cons of using friends.

## Exercise 7.22

> Update your *Sales_data* class to hide its implementation. The programs you've written to use *Sales_data* operations
> should still continue to work. Recompile those programs with your new class definition to verify that they still work.

##Exercise 7.23

> Update your *Person* class to hide its implementation.
