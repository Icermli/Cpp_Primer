##Exercise3.2

> Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time. Motify your program to read a word at time.

##Exercise3.3

> Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the getline function.

- code like `is >> s` is separated by whitespaces while reading.

- code like `getline(is, s)` is separated by newline `\n` while reading.

##Exercise3.4

> Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if not, report which is longer.

##Exercise3.5

> Write a program to read strings from the standard input, concatenating what is read into one large string. Next, change the program separate adjacent input strings by a space.
