##Exercise3.1

> Rewrite the exercises from ยง 1.4.1 (p.13) and ยง 2.6.2 (p.76) with appropriate using declarations.

[ex3.1_1-codelink](exercise3.1_1.cc)
[ex3.1_2-codelink](exercise3.1_2.cc)

##Exercise3.2

> Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time. Motify your program to read a word at time.

[ex3.2-codelink](exercise3.2.cc)

##Exercise3.3

> Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the getline function.

- code like `is >> s` is separated by whitespaces while reading.

- code like `getline(is, s)` is separated by newline `\n` while reading.

##Exercise3.4

> Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if not, report which is longer.

[ex3.4-codelink](exercise3.4.cc)

##Exercise3.5

> Write a program to read strings from the standard input, concatenating what is read into one large string. Next, change the program separate adjacent input strings by a space.

[ex3.5-codelink](exercise3.5.cc)

##Exercise3.6

> Use a range for to change all the charaters in a string to X.

[ex3.6-codelink](exercise3.6.cc)

##Exercise3.7

> What would happen if you define the loop control variable in the previous exercise as type char? Predict the results and then change your program to use a char to see if you were right.

the string won't change. we must use reference to change the value of the character in a string.in this case, `char` `c` is copy of each character of string, thus the assignment actually do nothing.

[ex3.7-codelink](exercise3.7.cc)

##Exercise3.8

> Rewrite the program in the first exercise, first using a while and again using a traditional for loop. Which of the three approaches do you prefer and why?

[ex3.8-codelink](exercise3.8.cc)

i like range for. no reason.

##Exercise3.9

> What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?

```cpp
string s;
cout << s[0] << endl;
```

print a empty line. it is valid.

##Exercise3.10

> Write a program that reads a string of charaters including punctunation and writes what was read but with the punctuation removed.

[ex3.10-codelink](exercise3.10)

##Exercise3.11

> Is the following range for legal? If so, what is the type of c?

```cpp
const string s = "Keep out!";
for (auto &c : s) {/* ... */}
```

if you don't attempt to change the characters of the string `s`, it is legal.

##Exercise3.12

> Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.

```cpp
(a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;
(b) vector<string> svec = ivec;
(c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");
```

##Exercise3.13

> How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What are the values of the elements?

```cpp
(a) vector<int> v1;
(b) vector<int> v2(10);
(c) vector<int> v3(10, 42);
(d) vector<int> v4{10};
(e) vector<int> v5{10, 42};
(f) vector<string> v6{10};
(g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};
```

##Exercise3.14

> Write a program to read a sequence of ints from cin and store those values in a vector.

##Exercise3.15

> Repeat the previous program but read strings this time.

##Exercise3.16

> Write a program to print the size and contents of the vectors from exercise3.13. Check whether your answers to that exercise were correct. If not, restudy ยง3.3.1 (p.97) until you understand why you were wrong.

##Exercise3.17

> Read a sequence of words from cin and store the values a vector. After you've read all the words, process the vector and change each word to uppercase. Print the transformed elements, eight words to a line.
