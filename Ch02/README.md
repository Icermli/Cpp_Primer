##Exercise 2.1

> What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

##Exercise 2.2

> To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

##Exercise 2.3

> What output will the following code produce?

##Exercise 2.4

> Write a program to check whether your predictions were correct. If not, study this section until you understand what the problem is.

##Exercise 2.5

> Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:
- (a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
- (b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
- (c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
- (d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2

##Exercise 2.6

> What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:
```cpp
int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;
```

##Exercise 2.7

> What values do these literals represent? What types does each have?
- (a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012"
- (b) 3.14e1L
- (c) 1024f
- (d) 3.14L

##Exercise 2.8

> Using escape sequence, write a program to print 2M followed by a newline. Modify the program to print 2, then a tab, then an M, followed by a newline.

##Exercise 2.9

> Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain what's wrong and how to correct it.
- (a) std::cin >> int input_value;
- (b) int
